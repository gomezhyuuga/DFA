Deterministic Finite Automata (DFA) application to test validity
of inputs against an alphabet and transition function.

A **Deterministic Finite Automata (DFA)** is defined as a *5-tuple*
M = (Q, Σ, q, F, 𝛿), where:

- Q: is a finite set of states
- Σ: is an alphabet
- q: is an *initial state*
- F: is a set of accepted states
- 𝛿: is a *transition function* which determines how to jump from one state to another.
