Deterministic Finite Automata (DFA) application to test validity
of inputs against an alphabet and transition function.

A **Deterministic Finite Automata (DFA)** is defined as a *5-tuple*
\\( M = (Q, \Sigma, q_0, F, \delta) \\), where:

- \\( Q      \\): is a finite set of states
- \\( \Sigma \\): is an alphabet
- \\( q_0 \\): is an *initial state*
- \\( F \\): is a set of accepted states
- \\( \delta \\): is a *transition function* which determines how to jump from one state to another.
